#Terminologies

  

## Node

###"Node" is the ROS term for an executable that is connected to the ROS network. Here we'll create a publisher ("talker") node which will continually broadcast a message.

  

## Catkin Workspaces

###Followed tutorials for creating a catkin workspace and package, which contains an src folder where you put packages that are part of the project. These packages will be built together. This will besides other things create a devel folder where you'll find a setup.bash (or other) which you should source or add to your .bashrc file to be able to access the packages from that given workspace anywhere using a command line and for ros to 'see them'. You need to build your workspace even if you're using python, because besides other things catkin will build your messages etc. and prepare links that you can access within python or C++ subsequently
